# Online Course Radial Progress Bar

In the dynamic landscape of online learning, my fascination with a sophisticated radial progress bar, elegantly tracking video consumption, sparked the creation of this project. Aiming to not only comprehend but also implement this engaging concept, I chose to leverage Next.js for its robustness, TypeScript for static typing, and Tailwind CSS for a pragmatic approach to styling.

## Motivation

- **Interactive Lessons Tabs**: Streamlined navigation through different lessons via an intuitive tab-based interface.
- **Responsive Design**: A meticulously crafted layout ensuring adaptability across a spectrum of devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Employed

- **Next.js**: A robust React framework for building performant and scalable web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Adding a layer of static typing for enhanced code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that facilitates rapid and consistent styling.
